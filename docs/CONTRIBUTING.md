## 📋 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Documentation
- Update README.md if adding new demos
- Include physics explanations in comments
- Provide usage examples
- Document any new dependencies

### Testing
- Test your code on multiple platforms if possible
- Verify that all existing demos still work
- Include error handling for edge cases
- Test with different QuTiP versions if applicable

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

When reporting bugs, please include:
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- System information (OS, Python version, QuTiP version)
- Error messages or screenshots

## 💡 Suggesting Features

For feature requests, please:
- Check if the feature already exists
