# Screenshot Placeholders

This directory is ready for demo screenshots. To make the README fully visual, add these screenshots:

## Required Screenshots:

### 1. `bloch_sphere_rabi.png`
- **Demo**: `python bloch_rabi_demo.py`
- **What to capture**: The first plot showing Bloch sphere with trajectory
- **Best moment**: When trajectory shows clear oscillation pattern

### 2. `quantum_gates_bloch.png`
- **Demo**: `python bloch_rabi_demo.py` 
- **What to capture**: The quantum gates demonstration plot
- **Best moment**: The 2x4 grid showing different gate effects

### 3. `decoherence_comparison.png`
- **Demo**: `python decoherence_demo.py`
- **What to capture**: The main decoherence plots showing all effects
- **Best moment**: When differences between closed/open systems are clear

### 4. `coherence_loss.png`
- **Demo**: `python decoherence_demo.py`
- **What to capture**: The coherence decay plots
- **Best moment**: Showing exponential decay curves

### 5. `cavity_qed_rabi.png`
- **Demo**: `python cavity_qed_demo.py`
- **What to capture**: Vacuum Rabi oscillations plot
- **Best moment**: Clear energy exchange oscillations

### 6. `photon_statistics.png`
- **Demo**: `python cavity_qed_demo.py`
- **What to capture**: Photon number distribution plots
- **Best moment**: Different quantum states comparison

### 7. `interactive_demo.png`
- **Demo**: `python interactive_demo.py`
- **What to capture**: Full interface with controls and plots
- **Best moment**: When showing interesting dynamics

### 8. `demo_launcher.png`
- **Demo**: `python run_demos.py`
- **What to capture**: Terminal showing the demo menu
- **Best moment**: Main menu with all options visible

## How to Add Screenshots:

1. Run each demo
2. Take screenshots at the suggested moments
3. Save as PNG files with the exact names above
4. Place in this directory
5. The README will automatically display them

## Tips for Best Screenshots:

- Use full screen for better resolution
- Ensure plot titles and labels are clearly visible
- Capture moments when dynamics are most interesting
- Use consistent window sizes for uniformity
- Include terminal output for demo_launcher.png
